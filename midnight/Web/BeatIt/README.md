# Web - BeatIt

**Level :** Very easy

Youâ€™re up against The Botâ€”a relentless, merciless, cold-hearted machine that plays first. Why? Because I said so. ðŸ˜ˆ

**The Rules** (That You Must Obey)
There are 20 sticks on the table. They stare at you. You stare back.
The bot always starts. No negotiations. This is my game, my rules ðŸ˜ˆ.
On your turn, you can remove 1, 2, or 3 sticks. Choose wisely, mortal.
The player who takes the last stick LOSES. Meaning, if you pick up that final lonely stickâ€¦ it's Game Over. And the bot laughs at you. Probably.
