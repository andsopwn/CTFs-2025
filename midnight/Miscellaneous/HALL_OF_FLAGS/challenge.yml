description: "**Signal lost... Attempting data restoration...**
<br><br>
A corrupted memory fragment has resurfaced on the MIDNIGHT underground network. Battle traces, remnants of a forgotten team... An anomaly lingers within the archives of an old trainer.<br>
The **Hall of Fame** records every victory, yet the very first entry seems to have been erased. Who were the true champions? What secrets lie buried in the depths of this save file?<br>
Mission:<br>
A save file **pokemon_save.sav** has been intercepted. Uncover the first team that marked the Hall of Fame. Access to this data is locked. Only the right tools can unearth these digital memories...
