# HALL OF FLAGS

## üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Signal lost... Attempting data restoration...

A corrupted memory fragment has resurfaced on the MIDNIGHT underground network. Battle traces, remnants of a forgotten team... An anomaly lingers within the archives of an old trainer.

The **Hall of Fame** records every victory, yet the very first entry seems to have been erased. Who were the true champions? What secrets lie buried in the depths of this save file?

### üï∂Ô∏è Mission

A save file (`pokemon_save.sav`) has been intercepted. Your objective: uncover the **first team** that marked the Hall of Fame.

But access to this data is locked. Only the right tools can unearth these digital memories...

The flag follow the format **MCTF{flag}**.
