<br><br>
A new anomaly has surfaced in the MIDNIGHT underground network. A second ripple in the archives of a forgotten trainer. Someone has rewritten history, leaving behind the remnants of another legendary battle.
<br><br>
The Hall of Fame has been altered. A <b>new team</b> now stands where the first champions once ruled. But this is no ordinary squad â€” its origin is buried deep in the digital echoes of the past.
<br><br>
Mission :<br>
A save file <b>pokemon_save2.sav</b> has been intercepted. Identify the new team that conquered the Hall of Fame. But your task doesn't end there. This team has a history, a legacy forged in the heat of battle.<br>
<strong>Find out when it was created.</strong>
