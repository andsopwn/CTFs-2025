<br><br>
Hi Choum, I am on a mission and I need your help !<br>
I am trying to recover a **Perk Shard** but I got called in for a damn Cyberpsycho who's wreaking havoc not far from my position.<br>
I don't have the time to go there, I'm getting shot at from all sides by drones !<br>
I send you a photo of my position, can you get some info on the cyberpsycho ?
