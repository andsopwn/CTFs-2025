description: "In the neon-lit depths of Neon City, a rogue NeuraTek insider has leaked a compromised workstation used by Nexus engineers. Rumors suggest a hidden backdoor within the system.
<br><br>
Your mission is to analyze the machine, track down the malicious binary, and retrieve its MD5 hash.<br>
Unmask the ghost in the machine before NeuraTek covers its tracks!
<br><br>
PS : the attacker changed the password of the machine, you'll have to find a way to bypass it yourself.
